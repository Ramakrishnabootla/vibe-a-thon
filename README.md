# vibe-a-thon

This repository contains a modular and reusable React + TypeScript component for creating and managing AI prompts. It provides a user interface similar to platforms like OpenAI Playground or PromptFlow, allowing users to:

Write and edit prompts with variable placeholders (e.g., {topic}).
Input values for the defined variables.
Select an AI model (currently supports OpenAI models).
Run the prompt by calling the OpenAI API.
View the AI model's response.
Optionally save and load prompt templates locally using localStorage.
This component is designed to be easily integrated into various React applications and serves as a good candidate for contribution to an open-source AI UI library.
